This is the blog for the [Astronomical Data Group](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/astronomical-data/) at the [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/) in New York City.
The plan is for one member of the group to post a short update about their research every week with a figure and a few notes about the work in progress.
We meet every week for group meeting and share similar updates and thought that it would be interesting to share these updates more broadly as an experiment in open science.
