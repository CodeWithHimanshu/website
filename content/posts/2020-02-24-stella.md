I wanted to share a machine learning project I've been working on with [Adina Feinstein](http://github.com/afeinstein20), a PhD student at University of Chicago who many of you TESS users may already know from her [Eleanor](https://github.com/afeinstein20/eleanor) package. We've designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically and rapidly detect flares in TESS data of young stars with minimal data preprocessing.

Neural networks are able to learn features directly from the data rather than having them hand-engineered by mere humans. CNNs are a special type of neural network that are especially good at identifying shapes in the data -- a good thing if you're looking for flares, which have a characteristic sharp rise and slow decline.
