This is the first post for our site and it's pretty meta.
This week at group meeting, I presented this blog to the group (pictured above).
Our goal is to use this as a way to highlight some of the things that we work on in our group, to give ourselves some amount of accountability, and to practice open and transparent science.
After this post, the plan is that each week one group member will post the figure that they presented in group meeting with a short description of what they're working on, what they've recently learned, and (perhaps) where they're stuck.
We hope you enjoy it and we hope that we all learn something.
